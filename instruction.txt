I'm creating my online Portoflio with Next.JS and Tailwind CSS for styling. I've chosen a modern style with futuristic animations to show my interest in the future and my passion for technology. 
I created my website in dark mode and I'm using the following libraries :
- Next.JS
- Tailwind CSS
- FontAwesome
- Framer Motion
- React
- React Icons
- React Scroll
- React Scroll Reveal
- React Typed
- React Typed Hooks
- React Reveal
- React Reveal Hooks
